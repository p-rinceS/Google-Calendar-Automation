Hi all,

Made using VSC and python. Attempting to automate my google calendar in hopes of making it more efficient and fill it up by uploading a lot of important dates very quickly.

One big reason I was planning to use this for was to get a .csv or .JSON file of a list of dates for any sporting events that I am interested in, and automatically listing them in my google calendar so I don't forget.


Massive time waste but was an interested journey to create so feel free to use any or all parts of the code! Thanks!
